    "Inspector Andrea Markov receives a call that Lord Fauntleroy has been murdered in his manor house. She is told that only the cook and butler were present in the house at the time of the crime and that there is no evidence of an intruder. Further, she learns that the only possible murder weapons are a knife and poison. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving the police station the Inspector instructs Sargent Bernoulli to gather information on the outcomes of similar murder investigations. She tells the Sargent that it is entirely possible that both the maid and the cook could have worked together. Since the cook and the butler could have acted alone or together, we will assume independence: $p(C,B) = p(C)p(B)$  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the available data Bernoulli is able to construct the following tables for the probabilities that the cook, $C$, or butler, $B$ is responsible for the murder. "
